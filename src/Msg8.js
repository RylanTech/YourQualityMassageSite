                        Sports massage is a targeted approach to treating minor and chronic injuries. 
                        Sports massage therapists generally use a wide range of techniques to realign 
                        and loosen muscle fibres in individuals who experience sport-related tension. 
                        It can also be used to improve posture and condition an athleteâ€™s body so they 
                        can perform their best. In this modality we use more stretches and active release 
                        therapy.
