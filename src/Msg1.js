                    Swedish massage therapy is the most well-known and widely practiced type of 
                    therapeutic massageâ€”and for good reason. This type of massage focuses on muscle relaxation, 
                    targeting superficial muscles {`(rather than the connective tissues targeted in deep-tissue massage)`}` 
                    and increasing blood circulation. It is a great starter massage and wonderful for relaxation.
