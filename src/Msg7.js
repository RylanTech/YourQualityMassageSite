                        Myofascial release therapy is more intense and targeted than a relaxing massage. 
                        In a massage, the therapist typically uses rubbing, sliding, and kneading motions to 
                        target tightness and knots in the muscle. This type of therapy is recommended for people 
                        with muscle tightness from things like exercise, poor posture or stress.Myofascial 
                        release therapy, on the other hand, involves the application of sustained, targeted 
                        pressure of three to five minutes on the fascia that connects the muscles and bones. 
                        Ideally, this sustained pressure will release the tissue and improve pain and mobility 
                        issues. This type of therapy is less relaxing or enjoyable than a massage, but for people 
                        with chronic pain or deeper fascia injury that regular massage doesnâ€™t resolve, myofascial 
                        release therapy can be far more effective.
