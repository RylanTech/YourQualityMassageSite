                        Lymphatic drainage massage, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, 
                        relieves swelling that happens when medical treatment or illness blocks your 
                        lymphatic system. Lymphatic drainage massage involves gently manipulating 
                        specific areas of your body to help lymph move to an area with working lymph 
                        vessels. Beneficial for post-surgeries, post-plastic surgery especiallyâ€”and for 
                        unblocking sinuses.
