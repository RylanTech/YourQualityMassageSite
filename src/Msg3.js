                    The benefits of trigger point therapy are numerous. Not only is it effective in reducing 
                    headaches and muscle tension, it can also improve range of motion and flexibility. 
                    Patients have found it successful in improving their posture and relieving pain. “Knots” 
                    are the small, miniature “Charlie horses” of the muscles that cause spasms, pain and 
                    immobility. Trigger point therapy uses hard points such as elbows and knuckles to apply 
                    pressure directly onto the knots for relief. </Card.Text>
