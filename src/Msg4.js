                    At first, it might seem weird to have warm, flat stones placed in specific locations 
                    on your body. But these are special stones with a purpose. Massage therapists typically 
                    use Basalt river rocks. These rocks are smooth and hold heat well. Using a stone heater, 
                    your therapist heats the stones to temperatures between 110 and 130Â° Fahrenheit. 
                    This is the ideal temperature range to warm your muscles without burning skin. Stones 
                    sit along your spine, on your chest, feet, palms, and even your face. 
                    After the stones heat your muscles, your therapist begins the massage. Taking advantage 
                    of warm muscles helps improve the benefits of hot rock massage.
